# Version 2.1.0.1
* developer-changes
    * now assets and code-mods localizations can be exported
    * for code-mods the required information is gathered after the game itself is started
    * for assets the required information is gathered after switching from settings-tab to developers-tab
    * due to technical limitations, for some asstes/code-mods the respective localizations can not be exported, so those assets/code-mods do not appear within the respective drop-down
